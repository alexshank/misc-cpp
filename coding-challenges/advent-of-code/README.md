Solutions to the coding challenges found at https://adventofcode.com/.

I am completing the 2019 Advent of Code and reading *Programming Principles and Practices Using C++* to familiarize myself with C++. I plan to eventually use C++ in some embedded projects.

## Running C++ code within Visual Studio Code (Notes)
1. Open Developer Command Prompt for VS 2017
2. Change to the directory of the current challange
3. Use `code .` to start Visual Studio Code instance
4. Follow [this guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-msvc) to create build and debug scripts.
5. Use `ctrl+shift+b` to build the current file or `F5 ` to debug the current file.
6. Run the generated `solution.exe` to observe output.
