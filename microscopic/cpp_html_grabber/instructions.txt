To compile and run this program:
$ g++ new.cpp -o new -lcurl -lcurlpp
$ ./new

Note: I had to find a weird hack online for /usr/include/curlpp/Option.inl to get it to compile properly. The right way to fix this would be with a clean install of curlpp in the right directory.

Note-2: curlpp/curlpp.hpp was changed to curlpp/cURLpp.hpp for the program to compile properly.
